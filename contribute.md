Contribution Guide
-----------------

### Image assets

- SVG is preferred over JPG, PNG, SVG is recommended to be optimized through [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo).
- When PNG is used, it is recommended to use a PNG compresser such as [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). (There is [cli version of it](https://github.com/tinify/tinify-nodejs) too!)
- Image assets that were replaced by datauri are going into `src/image-assets/`
